# "Host Your Web Site in the Cloud: AWS Made Easy by Jeff Barr"

Node.js/Express code samples for working with AWS. Based on the PHP samples from Jeff Barr's book.

The Node.js AWS SDK documentation is available [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/index.html).

### Setup

Create an IAM user on AWS and store the access keys in `~/.aws/credentials`.

```
[default]
aws_access_key_id = your_access_key
aws_secret_access_key = your_secret_key
```
